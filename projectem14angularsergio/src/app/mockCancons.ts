      I wish I had a better voice

      I wish I found some chords
      In an order that is new
      I wish I didn't have to rhyme
      Every time I sang
      I was told when I get older
      All my fears would shrink
      But now I'm insecure
      And I care what people think
      My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
      My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

      We're stressed out
      Sometimes a certain smell will
      Take me back to when I was young
      How come I'm never able to identify
      Where it's coming from?
      I'd make a candle out of it
      If I ever found it
      Try to sell it, never sell out of it
      I'd probably only sell one
      It'd be to my brother, cause we have the same nose
      Same clothes, home grown
      The stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
      But it would remind us of when
      Nothing really mattered
      Out of student loans and tree house homes
      We all would take the latter
      My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

      To the good old days
      When our momma sang us to sleep
      But now we're stressed out
      Used to play pretend
      Give each other different names
      We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
      Used to dream of outer space
      But now they're laughing at our face singing
      "Wake up, you need to make money", yeah

      If you had
      One shot
      Or one opportunity
      To seize everything you ever wanted
      In one moment
      Would you capture it
      Or just let it slip?
      Yo
      His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
      There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
      He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
      To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
      What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
      He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
      He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now
      The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow
      Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity
      Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked
      He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No
      He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes
      It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke
      He's so stagnant, he knows, when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
      Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody
      Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
      You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
      You own it, you better never let it go
      You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
      This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
      You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
      You own it, you better never let it go
      You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
      This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
      You better
      His soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping
      This world is mine for the taking
      Make me king, as we move toward a New World Order
      A normal life is borin', but super stardom's close to post mortem
      It only grows harder, only grows hotter
      He blows, it's all over, these hoes is all on him
      Coast to coast shows, he's known as the Globetrotter
      Lonely roads, God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
      He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
      But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
      These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
      They moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove and sold nada
      So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on
      Da-da-dum, da-dum, da-da
      You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
      You own it, you better never let it go
      You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

      You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
      This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
      You better
      No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
      Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
      I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed
      I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
      But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
      Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
      All the pain inside amplified by the
      Fact that I can't get by with my nine to
      Five and I can't provide the right type of
      Life for my family 'cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
      And its no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer
      This is my life and these times are so hard
      And it's getting even harder tryna feed and water my seed, plus
      Teeter totter, caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
      Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much
      For me to wanna stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
      Gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got
      To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
      Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
      Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
      So here I go, is my shot
      Feet, fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got
      You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
      You own it, you better never let it go
      You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
      This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
      You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
      You own it, you better never let it go
      You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
      This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
      You better
      You can do anything you set your mind to, man`

      And when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up
      But you got to search within you, and try to find that inner strength
      And just pull that shit out of you
      And get that motivation to not give up, and not be a quitter
      No matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse
      'Till I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
      'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em
      'Cause when I am not, then I'mma stop penning 'em
      And I am not Hip-Hop and I'm just not Eminem
      Subliminal thoughts, when I'mma stop sending 'em?

      Adrenalin shots, the penicillin could not get the illing to stop
      Amoxicillin's just not real enough
      The criminal cop-killing hip hop villain
      A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
      You're coming with me, feel it or not you're gonna fear it
      Like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us
      You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
      Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzing up?
      For shizzle my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
      You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck!
      'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
      'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
      'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
      I'mma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse

      Music is like magic, there's a certain feeling you get
      When you real and you spit and people are feeling your shit
      This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
      Tryna hold on to it because you may never get it again
      So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
      And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end
      Because I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit gets in
      I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
      It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
      Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me
      But in this industry I'm the 'cause of a lot of envy
      So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
      That's why you see me walking 'round like nothing's bothering me
      Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
      You hate it but you know respect you got to give me
      The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney, Nate, hit me

      I'mma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse
      Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
      What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
      And it's absurd, how people hang on every word
      I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
      But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
      If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
      'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse
      That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
      My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
      I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
      But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles
      The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
      So this is like a full blown attack I'm launching at 'em
      The track is on some battling raps who want some static?
      'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
      A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so
      'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
      'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
      'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
      I'mma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse
      'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
      'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
      'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps

      The roof comes off
      (The roof comes off)
      Until my legs
